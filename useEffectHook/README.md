`useEffect` is a hook in React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, that allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, manual DOM manipulations, and more. The `useEffect` hook is used to manage these side effects in a React component.

The basic syntax of `useEffect` looks like this:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    // Code for side effect goes here
    // This function will be called after every render
    // You can also return a cleanup function if needed
    return () => {
      // Cleanup code goes here
    };
  }, [/* dependencies */]);

  // Rest of the component code
}
```

Here's a breakdown of how `useEffect` works:

1. **Function Argument:** The first argument to `useEffect` is a function that contains the code for the side effect. This function will be executed after the component has rendered.

2. **Dependencies Array:** The second argument is an array of dependencies. It is an optional parameter, and if provided, it determines when the effect should be re-run. If the dependencies array is empty, the effect runs after every render. If there are dependencies, the effect only runs if one of the dependencies has changed since the last render.

3. **Cleanup Function:** The function returned from the effect function can be used for cleanup. It will be executed when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change and the effect is re-run.

Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This will run after every render
    console.log('Effect ran!');

    // Cleanup function
    return () => {
      console.log('Cleanup function ran!');
    };
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the effect will run after every render because the `count` variable is listed as a dependency. The cleanup function will also run when the component unmounts or when the `count` variable changes.
